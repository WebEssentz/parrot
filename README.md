## ðŸš€ 2025-05-20: Features & Improvements

- **Mobile Safearea for Privacy Message:**
  - On mobile, the privacy policy message, textarea, and disclaimer are now wrapped in a "safearea". Tapping outside this area dismisses the privacy message, while taps inside do not.
  - This improves usability and prevents accidental dismissal when interacting with the input or privacy message.

## ðŸš€ Major 2025 Updates

- **One-Shot Search Mode:** When the Search button is selected, the next message always uses real-time web search, then reverts to the default model. No more infinite search loops.
- **Privacy & Transparency:** Avurna never mentions its training data, internal tools, or the ages of its creators unless specifically asked. Capabilities are described in plain language (e.g., "I can search Google").
- **Modern UI:** The header now displays "Avurna" in a semibold, modern font on desktop, and the original icon on mobile/tablet. The search button's lit state is user-controlled and visually consistent. The textarea input is cleared after sending a message.
- **Robust Model Handling:** Improved code structure for model selection and POST handling to avoid race conditions and ensure correct model usage.
- **Responsive Design:** Enhanced experience for both desktop and mobile users.
